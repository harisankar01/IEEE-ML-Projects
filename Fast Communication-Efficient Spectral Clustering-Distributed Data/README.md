# Fast Communication-Efficient Spectral Clustering over Distributed Data

Provides a spectral clustering approach to compute distributed data with low communication overhead.

- Generate a set of representative points that preserve the underlying structure of the data at individual nodes.
- The distortion-minimizing local (DML) transformations-based framework readily facilitates data mining tasks such as spectral clustering over distributed data while eliminating the need for big data transmission.
- Populate the learned clustering data to each node.
