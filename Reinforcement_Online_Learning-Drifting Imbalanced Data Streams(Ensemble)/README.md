# Reinforcement Online Active Learning Ensemble for Drifting Imbalanced Data Streams

The paper uses the ensemble classifier has a long-term stable classifier and a dynamic classifier group which applies a reinforcement mechanism to increase the weight of the dynamic classifiers, which perform better on the minority class, and decreases the weight of the opposite.

- Utlize a hidden probabity function and classification learning algorithms aim to predict the labels that is used to determine the concept drift.
- A weight reduction mechanism that will decrease the impact of the old concept and let the algorithms focus more
  on the current concep.
- There is detailed alogrithm for each process.
